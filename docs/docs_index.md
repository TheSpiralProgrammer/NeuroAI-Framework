## Introduction

The NeuroAI Framework provides a high-level abstraction of brain systems, such as the Prefrontal Cortex (decision-making), Amygdala (emotion processing), and Hippocampus (memory). The framework also integrates a reinforcement learning approach to decision-making, using Q-learning.

The framework is designed to simulate brain-like decision-making processes, making it suitable for AI projects that require modeling of complex, cognitive tasks.
